##Give attribution to the Philadelphia Museum of Art
Make sure that others are aware of the rights status of the Philadelphia Museum of Art and are aware of these guidelines by keeping intact links.
If for technical or other reasons you cannot include all the links to all sources of the Metadata and rights information directly with the Metadata, you should consider including them separately, for example in a separate document that is distributed with the Metadata or dataset.
If for technical or other reasons you cannot include all the links to all sources of the Metadata and rights information, you may consider linking only to the Metadata source on the Philadelphia Museum of Art’s website, where all available sources and rights information can be found, including in machine readable formats.
##Metadata is dynamic
When working with Metadata obtained from the Philadelphia Museum of Art, please be aware that this Metadata is not static. It sometimes changes daily. The Philadelphia Museum of Art continuously updates its Metadata in order to correct mistakes and include new and additional information. Museum collections are under constant study and research, and new information is frequently added to objects in the collection.
##Pull requests
Because these datasets are generated from our internal database, we do not accept pull requests. If you have identified errors or have extra information to share, please email us at Laura.Webb@philamuseum.org and we will forward to the appropriate department for review.

##No endorsement
Use of this dataset does not grant or imply PMA’s  approval, commission, or support of your work. PMA retains the rights to all of its trademarks, and they are not part of the dataset.  Ensure that you do not use the Metadata in a way that suggests any official status or that the Philadelphia Museum of Art endorses you or your use of the Metadata, unless you have prior permission to do so. If you transform or modify to the dataset, you must clearly distinguish the resulting work as having been modified from the PMA dataset. If you create a derivative dataset from the PMA dataset, we ask that you consider releasing the derivative under a CC0 license.

##Ensure that you do not mislead others or misrepresent the Metadata or its sources
Ensure that your use of the Metadata does not breach any national legislation based thereon, notably concerning (but not limited to) data protection, defamation or copyright. Please note that you use the Metadata at your own risk. The Philadelphia Museum of Art offers the Metadata as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning any Metadata published by the Philadelphia Museum of Art.
